The Cogmentary Journal Club is a multidisciplinary academic group interested in discussing state of the art cognitive science, consciousness, philosophy of science, and trends in AI, among other related subjects. We are a highly motivated UPF student and alumni association, with a profound intellectual curiosity. 


Our main goal is to read, discuss, and question academic journals and other scientific materials. During our monthly meetings, we set out on a journey to unveil the possibilities of science by following the groupâ€™s self-constituted curriculum. We are also interested in sharing what we learn through this experience on our website, as a means to reach a wider audience.
