Cogmentary is a multidisciplinary journal club interested in discussing state of the art cognitive science, artificial intelligence, consciousness, and philosophy of science.
{: style="text-align: justify"}
 
Our objective is to critically read, discuss, and question scientific research. In our monthly meetings, we set out on a journey to unveil the possibilities of science by following the groupâ€™s self-constituted curriculum. We are also interested in sharing what we learn through our blog as a means to reach a wider audience.
